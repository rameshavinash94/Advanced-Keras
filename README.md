Part 1: 

A) Write a colab/colabs where you will use advanced Keras deep learning constructs concepts

This is a very important assignment - helps you understand and have an edge over others

Please ensure you use the links i provided for hints as examples. Use your own creativity. Properly annotate your colab/colabs appropriately and write proper explanation and description. Properly demonstrate each of these aspects with either individual colabs or one colab having all these. 

i) User custom learning rate scheduler (see https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/11_training_deep_neural_networks.ipynb (Links to an external site.) onecyclescheduler example)

ii) use custom dropout - ( see MCAlphaDropout in above link)

iii) Use custom normalization - (see MaxNormDense in above link)

iv) use tensorboard - (see above link)

v) use custom loss function - (see HuberLoss in https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/12_custom_models_and_training_with_tensorflow.ipynb (Links to an external site.)) 

vi) use custom activation function,initializer regularizer and kernel weight constraint (see leaky_relu, my_glorot_initializer, MyL1Regularizer , my_positive_weights in above link)

vii) use custom metric (see HuberMetric in above link)

viii) Use custom layers (see exponential_layer, MyDense, AddGaussianNoise, LayerNormalization in above link)

ix) Use custom model (see ResidualRegressor and ResidualBlock example in above link)

x) Custom optimizer (See MyMomentumOptimizer in above link)

xi) Custom Training Loop (see 13 section for fashion mnist in above link)

 

Part 2 : 

Do the below codelabs to exercise your ondevice ML skills

and in github provide all the artifacts and screenshots of your work (do not copy from codelab the screenshot - i would like to see it running on your computer screenshot )

a) Mobile App and Image training on device: Build and deploy a custom object detection model using tflite on android simulator (https://developers.google.com/codelabs/tflite-object-detection-android?hl=en#0 (Links to an external site.))

b) Mobile app and audio training on device : Build a custom pre-trained Audio Classification model (https://developers.google.com/codelabs/tflite-audio-classification-custom-model-android?hl=en#0 (Links to an external site.))

c) Web app and image training on device: TensorFlow.js Transfer Learning Image Classifier (https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflowjs-teachablemachine-codelab?hl=en#0 (Links to an external site.))

d) Webapp and audio training on device : TensorFlow.js - Audio recognition using transfer learning (https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflowjs-audio-codelab?hl=en#0 (Links to an external site.))

e) Using out of box sdk to do ML ondevice : Use ML Kit to perform Recognize text and facial features with ML Kit: Android (Links to an external site.), and Recognize, Identify Language and Translate text with ML Kit and CameraX: Android
